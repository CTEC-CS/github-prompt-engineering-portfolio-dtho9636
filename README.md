# About Me

## Who I Am

My name is Daxton Thorne and I am currently a senior in High School taking the New and Emerging Technology program at Canyons Technical Education Center. I initially enrolled in the Programming and Web Development Program at CTEC for my interest in programming, but semester 2 introduced the new "AI" program, which I decided to take as well. 

Im interested in learning how LLMs work from a programming perspective. I want to focus on the programming side of AI because it is the part that I find most interesting as a programmer. I also want to develop the skills to train AI, and use effective prompt-engineering to get the results I want from LLMs.

## What Drives Me

I use AI almost daily to help me understand concepts, learn new things, and experiment with automation. I also use AI to help with different problems in my life. Personally, I am most interested in the intersection of AI and computer science/programming. I think AI should be used as a tool to automate simple processess and help people complete tasks efficiently, but there is still along way to go.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio contains 5 different professionally crafted, tested prompts that I've developed to get effective responses from LLMs. The topics range from business to personal goal building, and can be applied to a wide variety of circumstances. My ultimate goal with this portfolio is to display my prompt-engineering accomplishments and continue to improve my prompts.

My Approach:
I approached making the prompts using intentional design frameworks and testable scores to continuously improve them.

## My Current Focus

**Learning:**
- Prompt Engineering
- Training AI Models
- Developing an AI Work Stack
- AI Algorithms

**Building:**

- Typing

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Using AI as a tool, not a replacement** - The purpose of AI isn't to replace humans, it's to supplement the work we do.
- **Teaching others how to distinguish AI from reality** - Many people are unable to see when something has been generated by AI, which will only continue to be more dangerous every year.
- **Not using AI to replace thinking** - AI should be used to help humans learn, not think for them.

## Beyond AI

When I'm not working with AI:
- I enjoy programming.
- I like going for bike rides.
- I play videogames.

## What's Next

**Short-term (This Semester):**
- Develop a prompt engineering portfolio
- Learn new prompt engineering frameworks
- Learn more about AI training

**Medium-term (This Year):**
- Develop/train a personal AI model
- Learn about AI token generation algorithms

**Long-term (College & Career):**
- Get an internship at an AI company
- Learn how to program AI algorithms

## Why This Portfolio Matters

This portfolio is:
- **Helpful for many contexts** - My frameworks can be used for people in many different situations thanks to placeholders.
- **Applicable for different situation** - My portfolio has multiple different prompts in different genres. 

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with:
- Small businesses
- Goal-oriented individuals
- Programmers
- Anyone who can teach me something
