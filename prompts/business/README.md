## What Makes This Prompt Effective
**ROLE Framework:** I used the ROLE framework. It is an appropriate framework for this task because it allows me to incorporate a role for the chatbot, which will lead to a response similar to an actual business consultant.
**Organized Structure:** I structure my prompt this way because I wanted to get a reply that was specific and detailed. I included the role, objective, language, and an example in my prompt to get an output that was detailed and still easy to understand.
**Reusability:** My prompt is clear and reusable because it details exactly how the AI should respond, and gives the AI a “mindset” to format the reply in, resulting in an effective response.
**Clear Constraints:** I outlined my prompt with a requirement that the AI provides a certain number of risks in its reply, in a form of “constraint.” The reason I did this is because I don’t want the AI response to be too long or too short, so specifying a concrete number of risks gives just the right amount of output to look through and keeps replies consistent.

## Customization Tips
**For Technology Startups:**
Focus competitor analysis on funding stage, product differentiation, user acquisition strategy, and scalability. Include indirect competitors such as open-source alternatives or emerging AI-driven platforms. Emphasize speed to market and innovation cycles.
**For Retail / E-commerce:**
Highlight pricing models, supply chain strength, brand positioning, customer loyalty programs, and online marketplace competition. Include local vs. national competitors.
**For Investors or Formal Presentations:**
Shift tone from casual to semi-formal. Add basic financial metrics (market size, margins, customer acquisition cost). Replace general language with clearer data-backed reasoning. Include high-level projections and strategic positioning.
**Adjusting Detail Level:**
- Request estimated market size and growth rate, ask for SWOT analysis per competitor, include pricing comparisons and customer segments.
- Limit competitors to 2–3, restrict risk explanations to one sentence each.
- Specify geographic region, ask to prioritize operational, legal, or financial risks.
