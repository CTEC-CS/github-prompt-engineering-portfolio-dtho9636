# Business Idea Analysis

> *This prompt generates an output to help entrepreneurs decide if their business idea is worth pursuing.*

---

## Overview

This prompt produces an output containing:
- An analysis of the current market  
- A list of feasibility risks  
- A list of competitors  

It solves the problem of pursuing business ideas that are likely to fail, helping entrepreneurs avoid wasting time, money, and resources on weak opportunities.

This prompt is useful for deciding whether or not to move forward with a business idea. It is effective because the output provides a detailed overview of the current market, clearly listing competitors and risks so the user can make an informed decision.

### Best For:

- Someone with a full-time job who notices a gap in the market for a specific service but isn’t sure if it’s viable.  
- Someone meeting with a potential business partner who wants to sound prepared.  
- Someone with a broad idea who isn’t exactly sure who they are competing against.  

**Output:**  
Concise and informative, using simple language and listed examples so the user can make a final decision.

## What Makes This Prompt Effective

### ROLE Framework  
I used the ROLE framework because it allows me to incorporate a clear role for the chatbot, leading to a response similar to that of an actual business consultant.

### Organized Structure  
The prompt includes the role, objective, language requirement, and an example. This structure produces a response that is specific, detailed, and easy to understand.

### Reusability  
The prompt is clear and reusable because it explains exactly how the AI should respond and provides a defined “mindset” for formatting the reply.

### Clear Constraints  
The prompt requires a specific number of risks. This constraint prevents responses from being too long or too short and keeps outputs consistent.

## Customization Tips

### For Technology Startups
Focus competitor analysis on:
- Funding stage  
- Product differentiation  
- User acquisition strategy  
- Scalability  

Include indirect competitors such as open-source alternatives or emerging AI-driven platforms. Emphasize speed to market and innovation cycles.

### For Retail / E-commerce
Highlight:
- Pricing models  
- Supply chain strength  
- Brand positioning  
- Customer loyalty programs  
- Online marketplace competition  

Include both local and national competitors.

### For Investors or Formal Presentations
- Shift tone from casual to semi-formal.  
- Add basic financial metrics (market size, margins, customer acquisition cost).  
- Replace general language with clearer, data-backed reasoning.  
- Include high-level projections and strategic positioning.

### Adjusting Detail Level

- To increase detail: Request estimated market size and growth rate, ask for SWOT analysis per competitor, include pricing comparisons and customer segments.  
- To reduce detail: Limit competitors to 2–3 and restrict risk explanations to one sentence each.  
- To narrow focus: Specify geographic region or prioritize operational, legal, or financial risks.
